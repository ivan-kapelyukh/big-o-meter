# Project Turing

Have you ever seen a scary function and wondered what its time complexity is? Do you need to know how much the input size can increase before the runtime explodes out of control? Want to forget tedious recurrence relations?

Look no further! Project Turing is a complexity calculator: simply paste in your function and relax while the app performs dynamic analysis and statistical modelling, giving you a visual graph and verbal explanation of how your function really behaves.
