# Big-O-Meter

Have you ever wondered how efficient your loops, data structures and recursive functions really are? Look no further! Big-O-Meter is a complexity calculator: simply paste in your function and relax while the app performs dynamic analysis and statistical modelling, giving you a visual graph and verbal explanation of how well your code scales as the input size grows.
